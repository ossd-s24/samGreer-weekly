title: Week 3 - Re Git and Extension
---

# Git
The git exercise we did in class was a nice refresher. I've used git before, but mostly as a backup for local work. I haven't used it for a team project since my sophomore year, and even then each team member mostly worked on independent files, so it was nice to have a refresher on the slightly deeper levels of git. It's a tool that I want to understand better, and I hope to get my hands dirty with it more throughout this semester.

# Open Source Project
I am working with my group on "Find N Replace", an extension that can change the text displayed on a webpage. Working on the project has been interesting, as it requires a lot more structure than I was expecting. When I picture open-source projects, I think of big projects where single contributions are bug fixes or other relatively small drops in the buckets. This means that it's easy for one contributor to essentially be their own agent, with no oversight from the project itself. On this project, each commit fundamentally changed the project in some way, meaning that each contributor needed to closely communicate. While this is obvious in retrospect, it was interesting to see how the workflow of the project was different than expected.
