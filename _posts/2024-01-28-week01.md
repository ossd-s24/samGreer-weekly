My understanding of open source has broadened from the few days of class/reading we have done. Before, I would have described it simply as anything where the source code was available to anyone to use and edit. While that basic understanding has held true, a lot of the nuances of the topic have become much more clear. Things like the specific legalities of open source software were something I had never really considered, as they always seemed simple, but since it's the law even something simple is complicated and multifaceted.

The biggest problem with open-source projects is the probability of a lack of structured oversight. To highlight this issue, I'm going to talk about the [Adobe PhotoDeluxe Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PhotoDeluxe). As part of a class on Wikipedia I took freshman year, I wrote large sections of this page. Since then, the page has received mostly small edits about 3 times a year. While this isn't an important article that needs more attention, it does serve to point out that on open-source projects, things can get forgotten and overlooked. This is, at least theoretically, not a problem with closed-source projects, where people are employed specifically to work on edge cases and (again theoretically) make sure all parts of a project are attended to.

By far the open source project I use most frequently is Wikipedia (this is tangential at best, but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcfuA_UAz3I) talks about Fandom, the company behind most wikis, and how the site not being Free has caused a lot of problems). There are also a number of emulators I use that are open-source, primarily Dolphin, OpenEmu, and 351Elec. As part of this class, I also downloaded Firefox and have been trying to transition to only using it. All of these projects I only use (with the exception of some basic Wikipedia edits), and have not properly contributed to them in any way. A big reason behind taking this class for me was to really engage with open source projects more directly, both by learning about cool new projects I can use, and especially by contributing to projects for myself and others to use.
