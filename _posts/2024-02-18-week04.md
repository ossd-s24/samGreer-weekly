title: Week 4 - Re Extension Project(s)
---

# Our Project (Find N Replace)
My group created an extension that could do find and replace on a live webpage. Working on the project was interesting. I mentioned this last week, but the process of making the extension was clunkier than I had expected. The exercises on Git and the decentralized workflow on open-source projects made me think that we could be just as decentralized in assigning tasks as a group, but that was not the case. That said, my group was great to work with and we ended up doing more or less equal shares of the work, it was just less smooth than I was expecting. 

# Other Projects
I thought the other group projects were, by and large, interesting and well done. A lot of the ideas were things that, once someone else said them, felt very obvious but had never crossed my mind before. In particular, I thought the Study Tool was a very solid joke extension, and TikTock had an impressive amount of polish.
More than any one individual project, I found the discussion that took place across multiple projects to be the most interesting part of the class. The focus on making sure each asset a project uses is also open source and attributed correctly was something that hadn't crossed my mind. It highlights (again) how something as seemingly simple as "use this project in any way you like" quickly becomes legally complicated.
